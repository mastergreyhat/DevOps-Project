## Introduction

The "DevOps Project for Python Web App Automation" automates the deployment pipeline for a Python web application. It utilizes Git for version control, Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Docker for containerization, and AWS for deployment. This guide will help you effectively use this project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Git installed on your local machine: [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- A Jenkins server set up and configured: [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
- Docker installed on your local machine: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- An AWS account with necessary IAM credentials and an EC2 instance for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mastergreyhat/DevOps-Project.git
   cd DevOps-Project

### Configuring Jenkins

1. Configure a Jenkins pipeline job to monitor your Git repository for changes and trigger builds. Refer to your Jenkins documentation for detailed instructions.

## Making Changes and Testing

### Pushing Changes to Git

1. Modify the Python web application code as needed.
2. Push your changes to the Git repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update web app code"
   git push

### Jenkins Build and Testing

1. Jenkins will automatically detect your Git push and trigger a build job.
2. The build job will run automated tests to validate your code changes.

## Deployment to AWS

1. After successful testing, a pipeline in Jenkins will build a Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
2. The Docker image will be pushed to Docker Hub.
3. The Jenkins pipeline will deploy the Docker image to an AWS EC2 instance.

## Troubleshooting
